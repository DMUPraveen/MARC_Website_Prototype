# Hyperspectral Unmxinig

Hyperspectral unmixing is a core image processing technique in hyperspectral imaging that separates a "mixed" pixel's spectrum into its pure constituent materials, called endmembers, and estimates their fractional amounts (abundances), essentially answering "what's in this pixel and how much?". This crucial step helps analyze complex scenes by decomposing spectral signatures, enabling accurate material identification in fields like environmental monitoring, agriculture, and mineral exploration, using models (linear or nonlinear) and advanced algorithms like deep learning.
