  Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI, or GAI) is
  a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to
  generate text, images, videos, audio, software code or other forms
  of data. These models learn the underlying patterns and structures
  of their training data and use them to produce new data in response
  to input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.
